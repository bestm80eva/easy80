Library manager
===============

.. WARNING::
   This module is not yet or just partially implemented!

The Easy80-IDE comes with a GIT based library manager out of the box. This
library is hosted on GitHub and managed by the Easy80 team. One can
automatically pull this library and create a fork in case pull requests are
being requested. The library manager also allows to handle ones own library or
manage projects via GIT.
