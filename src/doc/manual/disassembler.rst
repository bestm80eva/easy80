Disassembler
============

.. WARNING::
   This module is not yet or just partially implemented!

The disassembler is one of the coolest planned features. The disassembler can
convert opcode read from the Z80 board and convert it to either assembler or
even better back to pascal again. Of course the disassembled code will be
different (to start with the variable names will be lost) to the original code,
but at least you can obtain workable high-level programming code.
