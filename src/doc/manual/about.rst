About Easy80
============
The easy80 project is built around the Zilog_ Z80_  8-bit based microprocessor.
The Z80 CPU is placed on a single board micro controller card. First introduced
in 1976 the Z80 CPU is a popular microchip. The Easy80-IDE is introduced to help
support hardware and software extensions to this micro controller. The
integrated developer environment contains a built in compiler and assembler as well
as a number of tools to assist in the process going from concept to final product.

About Easy80-IDE
----------------
The Easy80-IDE is a self-contained, platform independent executable. It has been
developed with FPC/Lazarus and is available on Mac, Linux and Windows in 32bit
and 64bit.
The philosophy behind the Easy80-IDE is to be minimalistic with a focus on the
task at hand. Not only does the IDE allow developing software for the Easy80
board, but also hardware development (eg. PCB design) and emulation are part of
the plan.
Developing an IDE, especially on that is available on multiple platforms is a
very large task. Luckily
