About Easy80
============
The easy80 project is built around the Zilog_ Z80_  8-bit based microprocessor. 
The Z80 CPU is placed on a single board micro controller card. First introduced 
in 1976 the Z80 CPU is a popular microchip. The Easy80-IDE is introduced to help 
support hardware and software extensions to this micro controller. The 
integrated developer environment contains a built in compiler and assembler as well
as a number of tools to assist in the process going from concept to final product.
