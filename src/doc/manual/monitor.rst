Monitor
=======

.. WARNING::
   This module is not yet or just partially implemented!

This feature consists of firmware that is uploaded to the Z80 and a module in
the IDE itself. Via the monitor, one can exchange data between a PC (or any other
device) and the Z80. Via the IDE one can read text data, but also graph data.
