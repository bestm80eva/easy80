I found a Z80 assembler source for Turbo PASCAL 5.5 (DOS), and it looked interesting.
So I decided to try to downgrade it for Turbo PASCAL 3.0, and that was successful also.
Unfortunately it could be compiled (as a single source file) only under DOS, because TP
under CP/M can only load source code files below approx. 40KB, and my file was much bigger.
So I thought about splitting it into parts and include them.
Fortunately my questions in a newsgroup were answered from Svend Broholm, he gave me the hint
with PCRYPT, a very smart tool which was able to shrink the source code (in fact it shrinks
it by changing all identifier and variable names, and the result look rather cryptic).
But as a result of this shrinking process, it can be compiled as a single source file even
with the CP/M version of Turbo PASCAL.

ASMZ80.PAS   - the unshrinked but modified source of that Z80 assembler, compiled under DOS w/o problems.
ASMZ80.TXT   - this file
ASMZ80PC.PAS - the shrinked source, looks cryptic (don't think about modifying it manually)
PCRYPT.COM   - the tool which shrinks the source code (running under DOS to XP, NOT Vista)
TESTZ80.ASM  - a test source code for the assembler
ASMZ80.COM   - the CP/M executable

If anybody has luck with extending the functionality of that Assembler, plz send me a notice.
